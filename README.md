# Spam Detection System With Enhanced MBO ðŸ¦‹

## Introduction

The Spam Detection System is a comprehensive tool designed to train and deploy models for classifying emails and SMS messages as spam or not spam. The system provides a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter for both training models and classifying messages. It supports multiple models, including a lite model, a legacy model, and an optimized model using the Monarch Butterfly Optimization algorithm ðŸ¦‹.

## Training Scripts

### `train_model_lite.py`



The lite model training script focuses on a streamlined approach with optimized parameters and enhanced feature extraction.

#### Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses lemmatization and removes stop words and punctuation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Adds additional features such as text length, word count, unique word count, uppercase count, and special character count.
- **Model Creation**: Builds an ensemble model using SVC, MultinomialNB, and ExtraTreesClassifier with predefined optimized hyperparameters.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs for dataset insights, word clouds, and performance metrics.
- **Metrics Saving**: Saves accuracy, precision, and F1 score to a metrics file.

#### How to Run Individually

```bash
python training/train_model_lite.py
```

### `train_model_legacy.py`



The legacy model training script retains the original model logic without optimization but updates the structure and adds visualizations.

#### Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses stemming and removes stop words and punctuation.
- **Model Creation**: Builds an ensemble model using SVC, MultinomialNB, and ExtraTreesClassifier with original parameters.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs for dataset insights, word clouds, and performance metrics.

#### How to Run Individually

```bash
python training/train_model_legacy.py
```

### `train_model_mbo.py`



This script trains a model using the Monarch Butterfly Optimization algorithm ðŸ¦‹ to optimize hyperparameters.

#### Features

- **Monarch Butterfly Optimization (MBO)**: Implements the MBO algorithm to find optimal hyperparameters for the model.
- **Parameter Optimization**: Optimizes parameters for SVC, MultinomialNB, and ExtraTreesClassifier as well as ensemble weights.
- **Model Creation**: Builds an ensemble model using the optimized parameters.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs for dataset insights, word clouds, and performance metrics.
- **Metrics Saving**: Saves accuracy, precision, and F1 score to a metrics file.

#### How to Run Individually

```bash
python training/train_model_mbo.py
```

#### The Monarch Butterfly Optimization Algorithm

The MBO algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization technique that mimics the migration behavior of monarch butterflies ðŸ¦‹. It is used in this project to find the optimal hyperparameters for the ensemble model.

**Key Components:**

- **Population Initialization**: Randomly initializes a population of possible solutions (butterflies).
- **Migration Operator**: Adjusts solutions based on the migration behavior, encouraging exploration and exploitation of the search space.
- **Fitness Function**: Evaluates solutions based on cross-validation scores.

## Dependencies and Libraries

- **tkinter**: For building the GUI applications.
- **nltk**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and tools.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **matplotlib and seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **wordcloud**: For generating word cloud images.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image handling in the GUI.
- **pickle**: For saving and loading model objects.

## Visualizations

The system generates several visualizations to help understand the dataset and the model performance.

- **Dataset Insights** (`dataset_insights.png`): Histograms and box plots showing message length distribution, class distribution, and word count by class.

![Dataset Insights](graphs/dataset_insights.png)

- **Word Clouds** (`wordclouds.png`): Visual representations of the most frequent words in spam and ham messages.

![Word Clouds](graphs/wordclouds.png)

- **Performance Metrics** (`performance_metrics.png`): Confusion matrix, classification report, and top important features.

![Performance Metrics](graphs/performance_metrics.png)

## Logs and Metrics

- **Logs**: The training scripts and applications output logs to help track the training process and any issues.
- **Metrics**: After training, key performance metrics are saved to metrics.txt in the models directory.
    
Example content of metrics.txt:
```
Accuracy: 0.9825
Precision: 0.9700
F1: 0.9750
```

## Error Handling

- The applications include error handling to manage exceptions such as missing models or datasets.
- Informative messages are displayed to the user via message boxes or log outputs.

## How to Train and Test Models

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure `spam.csv` is placed in the data directory.
2. **Run the Trainer GUI**: Execute `python train.py` to launch the training application.
3. **Select the Model**: Choose the model you wish to train (Lite, Legacy, MBO) from the GUI.
4. **Train the Model**: Click the "Train Model" button to start training. Progress and logs will be displayed.
5. **View Visualizations**: After training, navigate to the "Visualizations" tab to see the generated graphs.
6. **Check Metrics**: Metrics will be displayed in the "Model Metrics" section and saved to metrics.txt.
7. **Test the Classifier**: Run python app.py to launch the spam classifier application and test message classification.

## Additional Notes

- **Directory Creation**: The applications will create required directories such as models and graphs if they do not exist.
- **Model Artifacts**: Trained models and vectorizers are saved in the models directory for reuse.
- **Data Encodings**: The dataset is read with encoding='latin-1' due to special characters.
- **Stratification**: Data splitting uses stratification to maintain class distribution across training and test sets.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing NLTK Data**: If you encounter errors related to NLTK data, ensure that the necessary data packages (`punkt`, `wordnet`, `stopwords`) are downloaded.
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure all required Python packages are installed.
- **GUI Not Displaying Correctly**: Check your Python version and ensure that tkinter is properly installed.
